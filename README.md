# OwnCloudService | Proxmox

This project aims to make Proxmox management easier and involves a large number of users, such as small-sized offices and learning labs for small projects. By that means, this program communicates with the Proxmox server over official REST API with reference documentation [here](https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/api-viewer/), and provide basic action (Create, Start, Stop , Check status & IP address).

The main language for this project isÂ **Node.JS**, with speed and a large community around the world. For additional parts such as front-end, which are less important than core components and security but have a future plan, the language could be **React.JS** for the benefit of re-loading data without refreshing the page (very useful in console panel).
